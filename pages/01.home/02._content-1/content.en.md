## Welcome to the Hotdoy skeleton. Built using Hotdoy theme for [Grav CMS](https://getgrav.org)

A Grav Skeleton is effectively an all-in-one sample site. They include the Grav Core, required plugins, as well as appropriate pages for content and a theme for pulling it all together.

The Hotdoy theme for Grav was designed to make the process of creating a site as easy and quickly as possible. 
I strongly suggest you take the time to read all of the [Grav documentation](https://learn.getgrav.org/16) before using any Grav sites.
