        detail: "The hotdoy theme do support eCommerce trough Snipcart wich is interesting for **relativelly small eCommerce siteswith less than 150 products**. More than that would probably be harder to manage since Grav deos not include inventory management out of the box. The theme comes with a product page and a listing templates .  \r\nIf you intend to use Snipcart, I strongly suggest you go and read the documentation.  \r\nWe are currently using the version 3."
